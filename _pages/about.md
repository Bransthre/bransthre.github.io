Hello, this is (Dun-Ming) Brandon Huang
======

I am currently a (direct-entry) PhD student at University of Toronto studying Computer Science.
<span style="color:gray">Before that, I was a (Taiwanese) undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley graduating Spring 2025, I double major in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.

***Research.***
Currently, my research interest is a union of two directions:
1. How can we help high-DoF robots learn more efficiently?
2. Once they learn to do things efficiently, how can we smooth their integration into human society?

That said, my work is largely focused at the intersection of robot learning and human-computer interaction.

These interest was the result of several inspirations received from my time at labs across cognitive science and computer science:
- [Computational Audition Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html) at MPI for Empirical Aesthetics
- [Robot Learning Lab](https://rll.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley
- [Robot Vision & Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) at University of Toronto

I am grateful to have researched under the advisory of respectively: Prof. [Nori Jacoby](https://www.norijacoby.com/), Prof. [Carmelo Sferrazza](https://sferrazza.cc/) and Prof. [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/), Prof. [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/).


***Otherwise, I was largely invested in teaching.***
As a member of Berkeley’s CS undergraduate community, I also lead educational initiatives.
Some highlighted experiences follow. I am a TA (UCS2) for [DATA C100](https://ds100.org/) since Fall 2023.
I have also been a coordinator for an educational student organization on campus, [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.studentorg.berkeley.edu/#/), where I co-lead a 30+ people branch of this tutoring organization— to have served over 200 students for those two semesters.
I have also written some pedagogical content and personal notes for public use.

I haven't had too much time updating my website, but the autobiography is up-to-date!

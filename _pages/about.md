Hello, this is (Dun-Ming) Brandon Huang
======
A LOT OF THINGS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

I am a (Taiwanese) undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley graduating Spring 2025 (fourth year), I double major in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.

***Research Experience.*** Up to the point of writing, my research involves both disciplines of cognitive science and deep learning. Under a guest affiliation at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, [Computational Audition Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html), I have conducted cross-cultural research on psycholinguistic modalities like conversation tone and translation operations via the lens of iterated learning and sampling with people. Meanwhile, as an undergraduate assistant position at [Robot Learning Lab](https://rll.berkeley.edu/), I participate in deep learning research (unsupervised, reinforcement), with the coverage of experience spanning across developments of humanoid robots’ benchmark and multimodal, representational learning of these agents towards skill learning. A combination of these interests would be some reinforcement learning work with human-use implications, which I strive to explore using my next year.

***Teaching.*** As a member of Berkeley’s CS undergraduate community, I also lead educational initiatives. Some highlighted experiences follow. I have currently served as a TA (UCS2) for [DATA C100](https://ds100.org/) for two semesters. I have also been a coordinator for an educational student organization on campus, [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.studentorg.berkeley.edu/#/), where I co-lead a 30+ people branch of this tutoring organization— to have served a quite sizeable number of students throughout my experience at CSM. I have also written some pedagogical content and personal notes for public use.

***Otherwise.*** For more information regarding my undergraduate career (course projects, coursework taken, artifacts), you may browse the tabs above my homepage.

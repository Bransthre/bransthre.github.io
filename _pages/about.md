Hello, I am Brandon
======
I am a Taiwanese citizen and currently a third-year undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley, studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science.
This is my academic website for releasing information about the endless trauma that enforces my academic abilities, as well as a station of providing resources for what related responsibilities I currently hold in student organizations and as a course staff at my university.

Research-Related Projects
======
I am currently exploring research as a career path.

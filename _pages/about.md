Hello, I am Brandon
======
I am a third-year undergraduate double majoring in Cognitive Science and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley.

During summer of 2023, I was interning at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics under supervision of
[Computational Audition Group](
https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html
),
where I worked on several projects.
I now participate in research at this group in the form of ongoing collaborator, with two first/second-author projects on hand that we plan to lead into publications for.
To broaden my horizon and vision on different research disciplines within machine learning, I am currently entering reinforcement learning robotics research at
[Robot Learning Lab](
    https://rll.berkeley.edu/
).

In U.C. Berkeley, I have primarily focused on pedagogical works and courses. I have completed an awarded
[Data Science Discovery project in collaboration with Creative Commons](
https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/2022-12-07-berkeley-quantifying/
),
and a course project in Convex Optimization course regarding "Provably Deep Classifiers under Adversarial Attack".
I am now an undergraduate student instructor of the largest upper-division course in U.C. Berkeley regarding
industry-standard data science techniques:
[DATA C100](
https://ds100.org/
),
and coordinate the EECS 16A branch of
[Computer Science Mentors](
https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/
)
at Berkeley with another student.

My research interest aligns with the general problem of "What should humans and AI do to facilitate their coexistence
in a future society?" This curiosity brought me to a self-exploration project called LiP (LiaisonPartner), which is
a virtual personal assistant for managing my mental health. Over this self-initiated project I learned fullstack
engineering: especially on UI interfaces and statistical learning algorithms that support the backend of this
application.

My current works concern Human-Computer Interaction and representational alignment. Apart from the theoretical
studies of my current courseworks in engineering mathematics and machine learning, in my research, I also study a
different art for "designing human experiments and cross-cultural studies", which facilitates my exploration towards a
particular research problem I am interested in: the Alignment Problem, concerning the alignment of human and AI
cognitive aspects into a space of consensus and/or guidelines.

Hello, I am Brandon
======
I am a third-year undergraduate double majoring in Cognitive Science and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley.

During summer of 2023, I was interning at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics under supervision of
Computational Audition Group, where I worked on several projects. I am currently continuing this collaboration without
pay for the preparation of a publication and the continuation of an interesting project.

My research interest aligns with the general problem of "What should humans and AI do to facilitate their coexistence
in a future society?" This curiosity brought me to a self-exploration project called LiP (LiaisonPartner), which is
a virtual personal assistant for managing my mental health. Over this self-initiated project I learned fullstack
engineering: especially on UI interfaces and statistical learning algorithms that support the backend of this
application.

In U.C. Berkeley, I have primarily focused on pedagogical works and courses. I have completed an awarded Data Science
Discovery project in collaboration with Creative Commons, and a course project in Convex Optimization course regarding
"Provably Deep Classifiers under Adversarial Attack". I am now an undergraduate student instructor of the largest
upper-division course in U.C. Berkeley regarding industry-standard data science techniques, and coordinate the EECS 16A
branch of Computer Science Mentors at Berkeley with another student. I am currently seeking research opportunities
during the semester while continuing collaboration with the aforementioned research group.

My current works concern Human-Computer Interaction and representational alignment. Apart from the theoretical
studies of my current courseworks in engineering mathematics and machine learning, in my research, I also study a
different art for "designing human experiments and cross-cultural studies", which facilitates my exploration towards a
particular research problem I am interested in: the Alignment Problem, concerning the alignment of human and AI
cognitive aspects into a space of consensus and/or guidelines.

Hello, this is (Dun-Ming) Brandon Huang
======

I am a (Taiwanese) undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley graduating Spring 2025, I double major in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.

***Research.***
My research involves both disciplines of cognitive science and deep learning.
Under a guest affiliation at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, [Computational Audition Group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html), I have conducted (1) cross-cultural research on alignment of psycholinguistic modalities like conversation tone, (2) translation operations via the lens of iterated learning, and (3) human-based sampling methods to produce population-representative samples.
Meanwhile, as an undergraduate researcher at [Robot Learning Lab](https://rll.berkeley.edu/), I participate in deep learning research (unsupervised, reinforcement), with a prior research focus on enabling agents with complex action spaces, such as humanoid robots, to perform various manipulation tasks or enact with further agent-intrinsic information.
Eventually, I aim to look at the question of **"What helps high-DoF robots learn complex manipulation in environments of our daily lives, including human-involving settings?"**

A full list of my publications can be seen from my Google Scholars profile, at the left sidebar of my website, as well as from my CV, on the top-bar of this website.

***Teaching.***
As a member of Berkeley’s CS undergraduate community, I also lead educational initiatives.
Some highlighted experiences follow. I am a TA (UCS2) for [DATA C100](https://ds100.org/) since Fall 2023.
I have also been a coordinator for an educational student organization on campus, [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.studentorg.berkeley.edu/#/), where I co-lead a 30+ people branch of this tutoring organization— to have served over 200 students for those two semesters.
I have also written some pedagogical content and personal notes for public use.

***Otherwise.***

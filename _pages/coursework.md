## List of Courses I have taken (or am currently taking) as an Undergraduate
This page hosts a list of courseworks I have currently taken as an undergraduate.
Only courses with exceptional (beyond-A) grades are marked so.

### Spring 2024
**EECS 126**
**COGSCI 132**
**COM LIT 60AC**
**INFO 103**
(This semester's schedule is a bit less technical! Because (1) I am preparing for a third research position, and (2) My cognitive science electives need to be completed at some point, and many of them are by nature less technical.)

### Fall 2023
*Note: enrollment for Fall 2023 semester is ongoing.

**COMPSCI 61C:** Great Ideas of Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) (A+)\
The internal organization and operation of digital computers.
Machine architecture, support for high-level languages (logic, arithmetic, instruction sequencing) and operating systems (I/O, interrupts, memory management, process switching).
Elements of computer logic design.
Tradeoffs involved in fundamental architectural design decisions.

**COMPSCI 285:** Deep Reinforcement Learning (A)\
 Intersection of control, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Deep learning methods, which train large parametric function approximators, achieve excellent results on problems that require reasoning about unstructured real-world situations (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition, NLP). Advanced treatment of the reinforcement learning formalism, the most critical model-free reinforcement learning algorithms (policy gradients, value function and Q-function learning, and actor-critic), a discussion of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, an overview of imitation learning, and a range of advanced topics (e.g., exploration, model-based learning with video prediction, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and meta-learning).

**COGSCI C100:** Basic Issues in Cognition (A)

**ISF 100A:** Introduction to Social Theory and Cultural Analysis (P)

### Spring 2023
**COMPSCI 189:** Introduction to Machine Learning (A+)\
Theoretical foundations, algorithms, methodologies, and applications for machine learning.
Topics may include supervised methods for regression and classication (linear models, trees, neural networks, ensemble methods, instance-based methods); generative and discriminative probabilistic models; Bayesian parametric learning; density estimation and clustering; Bayesian networks; time series models; dimensionality reduction; programming projects covering a variety of real-world applications.

**EECS 127:** Optimization Models in Engineering (A+)\
This course offers an introduction to optimization models and their applications, ranging from machine learning and statistics to decision-making and control, with emphasis on numerically tractable problems, such as linear or constrained least-squares optimization.

**LINGUIS 100:** Introduction to Linguistic Science (A+)\
This course is an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of
language. The two main goals of the course are to impart the analytical strategies and reasoning
skills most important to the core areas of linguistics, and to give the student a sense of the structured
diversity of human languages. This course will cover the following core areas of linguistics: phonetics,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and socio/historical linguistics.

**PSYCH C61:** Brain, Mind, and Behavior

### Fall 2022
**COMPSCI 70:** Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory (A+)\
ogic, infinity, and induction; applications include undecidability and stable marriage problem.
Modular arithmetic and GCDs; applications include primality testing and cryptography.
Polynomials; examples include error correcting codes and interpolation.
Probability including sample spaces, independence, random variables, law of large numbers; examples include load balancing, existence arguments, Bayesian inference.

**DATA C100:** Principles & Techniques of Data Science (A+)\
Students in Data 100 explore the data science lifecycle, including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical inference and prediction, and decision-making.
The class focuses on quantitative critical thinking and key principles and techniques needed to carry out this cycle. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing.

**COGSCI 1B:** Introduction to Cognitive Science (A+)\

**COMPSCI 370:** Reading and Composition

### Spring 2022
**COMPSCI 61B:** Data Structures\
 Fundamental dynamic data structures, including linear lists, queues, trees, and other linked structures; arrays strings, and hash tables.
Storage management.
Elementary principles of software engineering. Abstract data types.
Algorithms for sorting and searching. Introduction to the Java programming language.

**EECS 16B:** Designing Information Devices and Systems II\
This course is a follow-on to EECS 16A, and focuses on the fundamentals of designing and building modern information devices and systems that interface with the real world.
The course sequence provides a comprehensive introduction to core EECS topics in machine learning, circuit design, control, and signal processing while developing key linear-algebraic concepts motivated by application contexts.

**MATH 53:** Multivariable Calculus (A+)\
Parametric equations and polar coordinates. Vectors in 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Partial derivatives. Multiple integrals. Vector calculus. Theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes.

**ENGLISH R1B:** Reading and Composition

### Fall 2021
**COMPSCI 61A:** The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\
An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to manage program complexity.
The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.

**DATA C8:** Foundations of Data Science\
The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance.
Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon?
The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks.
It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

**EECS 16A:** Designing Information Devices and Systems I\
This course and its follow-on course EECS16B focus on the fundamentals of designing modern information devices and systems that interface with the real world.
Together, this course sequence provides a comprehensive foundation for core EECS topics in signal processing, learning, control, and circuit design while introducing key linear-algebraic concepts motivated by application contexts.

## List of Courses as an Undergraduate
This page hosts a list of courseworks I have currently taken as an undergraduate.
I didn't take a crazy technical-centered schedule, but it isn't necessarily only a disadvantage.

## List of Activities per Semester
A list of extracurricular activities per semester.
Despite frequent participation, I don't write a lot about education yet because (1) some events encourage me to keep education-side of career a bit less public, and (2) I don't have that much experience to write about yet.

DATA C100
======
In Fall 2023, I hosted (or am hosting, depends on the time this is read) a discussion section.\
My section (is expected) to be at **VLSB 2062, Wednesdays, 12pm-1pm**.
Very soon I shall not be referred to by name, but the last thing that stands between my students and their lunch.\
Regardless of that, here is a table of resources that I have publicized during that section:

This section hosts pedagogical resources that I have publicized during my undergraduate career.

DATA C100
======
In Fall 2023, I hosted a discussion section.\
In Spring 2024, I am hosting a discussion section as well.
My section (is expected) to be at **Etcheverry 3105, Wednesday, 11am-12pm**.\
*Note: Unfortunately, I have a lab meeting right after this discussion section, so please send me emails or post on Ed instead if you have any questions :p

Here is a table of resources that I have publicized during that section:

CSM EECS 16A
======
As a former Senior Content Mentor and a current course coordinator in CSM EECS 16A team, I have created some resources
regarding content production and teaching 16A. A list of publicized resources follow.\
Note: Documentations are not publicized.
## Worksheet Problems
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aqYUEP21PiCLoAGVdQzNmIJRM7AsG87/view?usp=sharing) is a list of problems that I have written for CSM16A. \
I also write some exam problems for DATA C100, which I will only specify after the associated school year has passed and when exam solutions are publicized (so for now, no links here).

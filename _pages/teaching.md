CSM EECS 16A
======
As a former Senior Content Mentor and a current course coordinator in CSM EECS 16A team, I have created some resources
regarding content production and teaching 16A. A list of publicized resources follow.\
Our documentation is internal, therefore not publicized here, but I have authored around 50% of it so far.

## Worksheet Problems
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aqYUEP21PiCLoAGVdQzNmIJRM7AsG87/view?usp=sharing) is a list of problems that I have written for CSM16A (which may have some erroneous solutions due to typo's or missed commits in our [repository (link only available for CSM-affiliated users)](https://github.com/csmberkeley/csm-16a-v2)).

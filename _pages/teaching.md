This section hosts pedagogical resources that I have publicized during my undergraduate career.

DATA C100
======
In Fall 2023, I hosted (or am hosting, depends on the time this is read) a discussion section.\
In Spring 2024, I am hosting a discussion section as well.
My section (is expected) to be at **Etcheverry 3105, Wednesday, 11am-12pm**.\
*Note: Unfortunately, I have a lab meeting right after this discussion section, so please send me emails or post on Ed instead if you have any questions :p

Here is a table of resources that I have publicized during that section:
